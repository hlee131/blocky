# Blocky
Blocky is a simple, basic blockchain written in C. The goal of this project is to understand how a blockchain works and to develop a better understanding of the C Programming Language. Thus, much of this project will not involve third-party libraries and will be written by the author instead. 

# Features Implemented:
- Basic blockchain functionality, i.e. blocks and an array of blocks
- SHA256 implemented without non-standard libraries
- Proof of work consensus mechanism on blocks 
- Blockchains can be saved as CSVs (Persistence) 

# Features To Be Implemented: 
- Transactions 
- Wallets 
- Importing CSVs
- Command Line Interface (CLI)
