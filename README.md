# Blocky
Blocky is a simple, rudimentary blockchain written in C. The goal of this project is to understand how a blockchain works and to develop a better understanding of the C Programming Language. Thus, much of this project will not involve third-party libraries and will be written by the author instead. 

# KNOWN BUGS (TODO)
1. Genesis Block gets overwritten when the blockchain is longer than 4 blocks.
2. Fix destroy blockchain method
